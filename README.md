# üßÆ COVID-19 Data Exploratory Analysis (SQL Project)

## üß† Overview

This project presents an **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the global COVID-19 pandemic using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. The analysis investigates patterns in cases, deaths, and vaccinations between **2020 ‚Äì 2024**, revealing how the pandemic evolved across countries and continents.

The dataset was sourced from **[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)** and contains over **414 k rows** of daily COVID-19 records.
All SQL code, analysis steps, and results are contained in the file:

üîó **[CovidExploratoryAnalysis.sql](./CovidExploratoryAnalysis.sql)**

## üß© Project Description

The goal of this project is to showcase how SQL alone can be used to perform **real-world data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and insight generation** without external analytics tools.

This project demonstrates the practical application of:

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window Functions (`SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY ‚Ä¶)`)
* Joins and Aggregations
* Temporary Tables
* Data-type conversions (`CAST`, `CONVERT`)
* Creating reusable SQL Views

The analysis provides insights such as:

* Global and country-level infection rates and death percentages
* Comparison of death burden across continents
* Vaccination trends and population coverage over time
* Global mortality rates and cumulative vaccination progress

---

## üåç Project Context

The **COVID-19 pandemic** transformed global health and economic landscapes. Accurate data analytics became essential for understanding transmission trends, mortality rates, and the effect of vaccination programs.

This project leverages SQL to transform the raw dataset into an **insight-rich analytical summary**, forming the foundation for visualization dashboards or further predictive modeling.

---

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

The pandemic led to unprecedented data generation worldwide. However, challenges such as inconsistent reporting, missing values, and fragmented data structures made it difficult to quickly extract reliable insights.

The core problems this project addresses include:

1.	Identifying and quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on populations through case and death trends.
2.	Tracking vaccination progress and understanding its effect on infection and death rates.
3.	Comparing trends across countries and continents to uncover disparities and regional differences.
4.	Designing efficient SQL-based processes for transforming raw data into structured, insightful, and reusable datasets.

## üéØ Aim of the Project

The project aims to perform a **comprehensive SQL-based exploratory analysis** of global COVID-19 data to uncover trends, compute key metrics, and identify actionable insights.

### Specific Objectives

* Calculate global and regional **infection and death trends (2020‚Äì2024)**.
* Evaluate **case fatality rates (CFR)** across countries and continents.
* Determine **the percentage of each country‚Äôs population infected**.
* Track **vaccination progress** using rolling cumulative totals.
* Create **views and reusable SQL components** for integration with BI dashboards.
* Identify **top countries and continents** by total deaths and infection rates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è My Approach

### 1. Data Exploration (EDA)

The project used two main tables:

* **CovidDeaths**
  Columns: `iso_code`, `continent`, `location`, `date`, `population`, `total_cases`, `new_cases`, `total_deaths`, `new_deaths`
* **CovidVaccinations**
  Columns: `iso_code`, `continent`, `location`, `date`, `total_tests`, `new_tests`, `new_vaccinations`, `population_density`, `death_rate`

#### Sample inspection query

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM CovidData..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY location, date;
```

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Converted data types for numeric calculations:

  ```sql
  CONVERT(int, total_deaths)
  ```
* Filtered out `NULL` continents to exclude aggregates like ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù or ‚ÄúEuropean Union‚Äù.
* Joined tables on `location` and `date` for synchronized case and vaccination analysis.

### 3. Analytical Process

Key analytical queries included:

#### a. Death Percentage (Case Fatality Rate)

```sql
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths,
       (total_deaths / total_cases) * 100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM CovidData..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL;
```

#### b. Infection Rate by Population

```sql
SELECT location, population,
       MAX((total_cases / population) * 100) AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM CovidData..CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location, population;
```

#### c. Global Summary Metrics

```sql
SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS TotalCases,
       SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int)) AS TotalDeaths,
       SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int)) / SUM(new_cases) * 100 AS GlobalDeathPercentage
FROM CovidData..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL;
```

#### d. Rolling Vaccination Totals

```sql
SELECT dea.location, dea.date, dea.population,
       SUM(CONVERT(bigint, vac.new_vaccinations))
         OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM CovidData..CovidDeaths dea
JOIN CovidData..CovidVaccinations vac
     ON dea.location = vac.location AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL;
```

#### e. View Creation for Visualization

```sql
CREATE VIEW PercentPopulationVaccinated AS
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population,
       SUM(CONVERT(bigint, vac.new_vaccinations))
         OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM CovidData..CovidDeaths dea
JOIN CovidData..CovidVaccinations vac
     ON dea.location = vac.location AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL;
```
